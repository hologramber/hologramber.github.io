In Japan, it is rare to see a URL in public messaging, regardless of the medium — the standard way to direct people to a website is by giving them a search term. Before smartphones became ubiquitous, typing Roman-letter URLs on a 12-key keypad was a hassle, whereas keying in a short Japanese word was doable, and the trend has seemingly never changed.

This approach requires trusting a search engine to send users to the right place, which has proved risky with the many cases in which malicious actors bought search ads and used the top spot to host phishing pages or distribute malware. “Ad network abuse” ranked among the top five policy violations in Google’s 2024 ad-safety report.

JC3 (Japan Cybercrime Control Center) maintains a <a href="https://www.jc3.or.jp/threats/topics/article-242.html">summary article on the issue</a>, and their 2024 report on malicious shopping sites (<a href="https://www.jc3.or.jp/threats/topics/article-608.html">悪質なショッピングサイト等に関する統計情報</a>) lists "internet search results" as the primary route which leads users to those pages, but my general feeling is that awareness is still quite low. It's not an issue unique to Japan -- not at all -- but with searching being the default way to find a site, the concern sticks in my mind.
