Converts between inter-pulse intervals/train burst widths and frequency/number of pulses & plots an example waveform (also my first foray into JS/jQuery). Mostly useful for visualizing spike trains in discussions or double checking math when hopping between ephys equipment.

Once you begin entering values, the example waveform will not plot until all values have been entered. Choose between calculating the waveform from the inter-pulse period and the train burst width, or from the # of pulses and the frequency of those pulses -- the alternate option will be displayed automatically.  Scientific notation is displayed on the right for reference with systems that require SN (AM Systems, yay).
