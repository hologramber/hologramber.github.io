If you've enabled Dynamic Host Management Configuration on AWS, and you're wondering why instances launched with the most recent Amazon Linux 2023 AMI won't automatically enroll, it's because DHMC requires SSM agent >= 3.2.582.0, and AWS hasn't updated their own distro -- it runs with 3.1.1927 and that's the latest version available via yum. If you want a newly launched instance to enroll, you'll either need to build your own AMI with an updated SSM agent, or add an install command to the instance's user data.
