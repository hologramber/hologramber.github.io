<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/newtab-color-void/enbboabmkalnjjaciinmnjfbhajpejbl?authuser=1&hl=en">NewTab Color Void</a> is a bare-bones Chrome extension I created when Chrome's "new tab" started including recent browsing history and bookmarks. It replaces the default new tab window with a single-color (customizable in options) screen. Requires no permissions from the user; doesn't have access to browsing information, Chrome tabs, or anything else. Source and instructions for a local build/install are available <a href="https://github.com/hologramber/newtab-color-void/">here</a>.
